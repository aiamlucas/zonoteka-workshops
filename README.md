# Zonoteka Workshop Series

We aim to develop a collaborative group that bridges the worlds of art and technology, bringing together artists, developers, musicians, filmmakers, and others.
Together, we share knowledge and collaborate to create performances, installations and artworks, while also developing open-source digital tools for artists or anyone interested in generative art, film and more.

## Projects & Activities

Our collective focuses on experimentation and collaboration through **workshops**, **group projects**, and **open-source contributions**.

1. **Workshops**:

   - Members of the group will regularly share their knowledge in focused workshops. These could include topics such as **FFglitch **, **lighting techniques**, **TouchDesigner**, or any other tool or medium the collective is interested in exploring.
   - Each workshop will be documented and made available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aiamlucas/zonoteka-workshops), so that others can access the knowledge and contribute.

2. **Collaborative Praxis**:

   - Beyond individual workshops, we will foster **collaborative praxis**—a space for integrating various skills and tools into unified projects. Whether it’s combining **video manipulation**, **lighting techniques**, **sound design**, or **live coding**
   - These collaborations will be presented in public showcases, **with real-time displays visible to the public** through Zonoteka's window. As we work on our projects, the creative process will be visible to passersby as a **work-in-progress** window showcase.

3. **Open-Source Tools**:
   - As we explore and experiment, we will also work on developing **open-source digital tools**. These tools will be made available to the broader creative coding communities through our GitHub repository.
