# Zonoteka Workshop Series

We aim to develop a collaborative group that bridges the worlds of art and technology, bringing together artists, developers, musicians, filmmakers, and others.
Together, we share knowledge and collaborate to create performances, installations and artworks, while also developing open-source digital tools for artists or anyone interested in generative art, film and more.

## Projects & Activities

Our group focuses on experimentation and collaboration through **workshops**, **projects**, and **open-source contributions**.

1. **Workshops**:

   - Members of the group will regularly share their knowledge in focused workshops. These could include topics such as **FFglitch**, **lighting techniques**, **TouchDesigner**, or any other tool or medium the collective is interested in exploring.
   - Each workshop will be documented and made available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aiamlucas/zonoteka-workshops), so that others can access the knowledge and contribute.

2. **Collaborative Praxis**:

   - Beyond individual workshops, we will promote **collaborative praxis** â€” a space for integrating various skills and tools into unified projects.
   - These collaborations will be presented in public showcases, **with real-time displays visible to the public** through Zonoteka's large street-facing window. As we work on our projects, passersby can view the creative process in action, turning our workspace into a dynamic work-in-progress exhibition. The window will also serve as a platform to display completed works to everyone on the street."

3. **Open-Source Tools**:
   - As we explore and experiment, we will also work on developing **open-source digital tools**. These tools will be shared with the broader creative coding communities through our GitHub repository, as well as through the individual repositories of our members.

## Current Projects & Topics

1. **Codec Art with FFglitch**: Creating visual distortions by manipulating multimedia files at the bitstream level.

## Tools in Development

2. **FFglitch Web Interactive**: A web-based platform for real-time control and glitching of multimedia using **FFglitch**. Built with **React**, **Express**, **Socket.IO**, and **ZeroMQ** for interactive experiences across mobile and desktop.
